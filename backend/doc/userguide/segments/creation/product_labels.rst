    One Segment consists of one or more conditions (types). Conditions can be combined through AND and OR logical operators.
    
     - **AND Condition** 
    
         is used to perform a logical conjuction on two conditions. Both conditions linked with this operator must be true. 
    
         **For example**, you can create segment with a list of customers who made purchase in specific POS and bought specific SKU. The list will contain customer who met both, 1st and 2nd condition.
     
     - **OR Condition** 
 
         is used to perform a logical disjunction on two conditions. At least one of conditions linked with this operator must be true. 
    
         **For example** you can create segment with a list of customers who made purchase in specific POS or bought specific SKU. List will contain customer who met only the 1st condition, who met only the 2nd condition and met both conditions.
