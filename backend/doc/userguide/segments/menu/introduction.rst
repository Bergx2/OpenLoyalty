Introduction
============

Customer segments allow you to e.g. dynamically count points, levels and display rewards to specific customers, based on properties such as system events, transactions history, purchasing activity, and so on. 

**Customer can be assigned to several segments**

You can optimize marketing initiatives based on targeted segments. You can also preview and export the list of targeted customers. 

Because customer segment information is constantly refreshed, customers can become associated and disassociated from a segment as they shop in your store.
