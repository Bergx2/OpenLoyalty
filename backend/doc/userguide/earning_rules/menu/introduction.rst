Introduction
============

Earning rules define ways and conditions for customers to earn points.

Points can be awarded for a wide range of transaction and customer activities, and the configuration can be set to control the point allotment, balance, and expiration. 

You can add point multipliers, eligibility criteria and even exclude certain products or customers. 

Customers can redeem points toward rewards, based on the condition (points cost) that you establish.
