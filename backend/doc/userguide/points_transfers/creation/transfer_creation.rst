Creating Points transfer from admin
===================================

Customers usually earn and spend points within Open Loyalty system â€“ points are added for transaction and activity based on Earning Rules and spent for Reward Campaigns selected by customer within customer cockpit.

However, you can also create customer points transfer directly from the Admin, which is useful in case of ad-hoc special situation e.g. long delivery delay, the biggest purchase among customers in year etc.
