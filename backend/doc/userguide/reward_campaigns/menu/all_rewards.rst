All Reward campaigns
====================

The All reward campaigns grid provide information about all rewards within your Loyalty Program with information about type, status, cost in points, limits of use, if and how many times reward has been used by customers and time boundaries of activity. 

Moreover, you can also see how many customers could use reward and preview theirs details.

Use the standard controls to sort the list, filter and search rewards by typing in the field under Name column header value you want to find, and apply actions to selected rewards record (modify, preview details). 

Pagination controls appear if there are more rewards records than fit on the page, and are used to move from one page to the next.
