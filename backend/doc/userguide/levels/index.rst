Levels
======

In this section of the guide, you will learn how to create and use customer levels to create opportunities for customer engagement and how to set up targeted discounts and rewards based on a variety of conditions. 

The more points customers receive, the higher level they'll reach. And, the higher level of loyalty, the more rewards customers will get.

You can use levels to offer customer incentives, such as: 

 - assigned a fixed reward to the particular level. The higher level â€“ the better reward

 - offer limited in time special rewards for customer assigned to particular level
