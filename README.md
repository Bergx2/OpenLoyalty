# Open Loyalty

Open Loyalty is a headless loyalty technology for visionaries and innovators who want to implement an effective loyalty program that cuts across multiple touchpoints. Our solution is 100% API-first and unlike old-fashioned, monolithic software, itâ€™s easy to integrate with and ensures complete flexibility, speed, and effectiveness at all levels.

## Editions

Open Loyalty is available in two editions - **Hosted**, and **Dedicated**.
Here you can find Open Source Edition (v.3.2). It is limited to non-commercial projects, does not provide guaranteed performance and scalability and therefore, it is recommended for testing purposes only. It is also significantly different from the current commercial editions of Open Loyalty.  

**We strongly advise using Hosted or Dedicated in commercial projects.**

Hosted or Dedicated editions are not available publicly on GitHub.
To get the quotation, please visit www.openloyalty.io and send the request.

## Business applications

There are a variety of ways Open Loyalty can be used to provide headless loyalty architecture. 
Based on it, you can build loyalty solutions like: 

* full loyalty programs for off-line and on-line channels
* mobile loyalty applications
* motivational programs for employees
* loyalty modules for your own product

## Performance and scalability
High performance and scalability are available in Hosted and Dedicated editions only.
In this [case study](https://www.openloyalty.io/building-a-massive-scale-loyalty-program-with-aws/) you can read more about how Open Loyalty reached over **1500 concurrent API calls 
with a response time under 1 second** and **Easy scalability with Kubernetes and AWS infrastructure**.

## Quick install

This project has full support for running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/>).

Go to the docker directory:

```
cd docker
```

Execute the below command to run the application: 

```
docker-compose up
```

After that, execute the below command to initiate and set up the database:
```
docker-compose exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

Before you start using Open Loyalty, you need to define hosts in your local environment. Add host openloyalty.localhost as 127.0.0.1 in your system configuration file (/etc/hosts).
If you find any problems using docker (for example, in Windows environments), please try our Vagrant recipe.

## Quick install with Vagrant

You should have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed before executing this recipe.

Then, please execute the following commands:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

That's all. Now you can go to the admin panel [openloyalty.localhost:8182](http://openloyalty.localhost:8182).
Default login is **admin** and password **open**. You can also go to customer panel [openloyalty.localhost:8183](http://openloyalty.localhost:8183).

## Vagrant helpful commands

- `vagrant provision --provision-with sync` sync current dir
- `vagrant provision --provision-with build` rebuild docker base images

## Url access

After starting Open Loyalty, it exposes services under the following URLs:

 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8182 - the administration panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8183 - the customer panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8184 - the merchant panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost - RESTful API port
 * http://openloyalty.localhost/doc - swagger-like API doc
 

## For developers

If you are a developer and want to attach source code, then you have to build base docker images:

```
./docker/base/build_dev.sh
```

and run containers:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Remember to setup database using bellow command:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec --user=www-data php phing setup
```

After starting Open Loyalty in developer mode, it exposes services under slightly different URLs:

 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/admin - the administration panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/client - the customer panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/pos - the merchant panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost - RESTful API port
 * http://openloyalty.localhost/app_dev.php/doc - swagger-like API doc

## Generate JWT keys

Running `phing setup` will generate the JWT public/private keys for you, but in case you would like to generate them "manually" use `phing generate-jwt-keys`.
